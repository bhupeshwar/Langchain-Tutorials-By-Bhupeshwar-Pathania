# Langchain

LangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.

# Environment

You can install your local environment with conda (recommended) or pip. The environment configurations for conda and pip are provided. 
Please note that if you choose pip as you installation tool, you might need additional tweaking.

# Conda

This is the recommended method for installing dependencies. Please make sure you have anaconda installed.

First create the environment for the book that contains all the dependencies:

<code> conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y </code>

The conda environment is called venv. You can activate it as follows:

<code> conda activate venv </code>

# Pip

Pip is the default dependency management tool in Python. With pip, you should be able to install all the libraries from the requirements file:

<code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
